# Walk-of-Fame
This is a fun guessing game that the user gets to solve. To find out which famous actor is on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

- For this project, I basically use web scraping techniques to first grab the top 100 most popular actors. 
- From those 100 actors I wanted to know which ones had a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
- Which sparked the idea of making a guessing game from that.
- I created a program that would randomly pick one of those actors, and the user would have to guess the actor. 
- I then used web scraping to get each one of those actors a created list of hints that the computer would give out if the guess was wrong.
- I added a life system and removed clues that were just not helpful or too helpful.
- Finally, when the actor was guessed correctly or you ran out of lives the program would end.
